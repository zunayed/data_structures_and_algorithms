/*
Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­ drome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
